"Things Forged In Fire And Steel Last Longer Than Those Made Cheaply" - Colby Bianco 3/6/19
"I see people as if they're jewels in a display, look at one look at them all and never stop staring, but people see me as a fish in the sea, not worth waisting time and bait if they don't really want it. I can't have it but I want it, you on the other hand can have it but you don't want it. Regrets?" - Colby Bianco 3-29-19 1:54 PM
